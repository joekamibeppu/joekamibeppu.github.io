					<h1> Joe Kamibeppu </h1>
				</header>
				<p> My name is Joe - welcome to my website! I am a junior studying Computer Science and International Relations at Tufts University. Born in College Park, Maryland and raised in Yokohama, Japan, I now live in Somerville, Massachusetts.</p>

				<br>

				<p> I am an avid outside runner - I like to think I've run on almost every street in the Medford/Somerville area. When I have time, I like to watch professional soccer and the NBA. I am also a big fan of Civilization IV. </p> 

				<br>

				<p> Some of my offbeat hobbies are Japanese calligraphy and cataloguing the history of New York City.</p>

				<br>

				<p> In order to come into contact with more music, one of my goals this year is to listen to 15 new albums a week. My regimen: 3 albums a day for 5 days, followed by 2 rest days. So far so good!</p>
